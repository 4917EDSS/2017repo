This folder is for any documentation that will be useful to us and isn't too 
robot-specific.  For example:

- Installation guides
- Tutorials
- Game instructions/tips

For robot-specific documentation (like how to calibrate one of the robot's 
sensors), use the docs folder in that robot's project folder.
