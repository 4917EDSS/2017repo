This folder is for code that can be used across multiple projects (aka libraries).

For example if we need to modify the source code that navx-mxp* gives us so it 
works for our needs, we can do that here and then share this code to all our 
projects.  This is better than having a copy in each project because if we find 
a bug or need a change, we only do it once.  We don't have to go back to every 
project to make the change (and likely forget some).

*The navx-mxp is the add-on board that tells the robot which way it's facing 
... among other things.
